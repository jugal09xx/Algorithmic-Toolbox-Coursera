# 🌟 Algorithmic Toolbox - Coursera

## By University of California San Diego & HSE University

> This repository will contain my work from the [Master Algorithmic Programming Techniques Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms) that was created by UC San Diego and delivered through Coursera. I will be implementing solutions in C++ and Java 8.
